# Simple Shell

## Overview

The Simple Shell project is a basic implementation of a command-line shell in C. It provides a prompt upon launch, accepts user inputs, processes shell commands, and displays the output. The shell continues to prompt the user for commands until termination.

## Features

- **Prompt on Launch:** The shell displays a prompt upon launching, inviting the user to input commands.

- **Command Processing:** Accepts user inputs, processes shell commands, and executes the corresponding actions.

- **Output Display:** Displays the output of the executed commands.

- **Continual Prompting:** After processing a command, the shell returns to the prompt, waiting for the user to input the next command.

- **Termination:** The shell continues to prompt the user until the termination of the shell terminal.
